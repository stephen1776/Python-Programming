  1 2 3 4 5 
    1 2 3 4 
      1 2 3 
        1 2 
          1

#### 0522 (Display prime numbers between 2 and 1,000) 
Display all the prime numbers between 2 and 1,000, inclusive. Display eight prime numbers
per line.
#### 0523 (Financial application: compare loans with various interest rates)
Write a program that lets the user enter the loan amount and loan period in number of years
and displays the monthly and total payments for each interest rate starting from
5% to 8%, with an increment of 1/8.
#### 0524 (Financial application: loan amortization schedule)
Write a program that lets the user enter the loan amount, number of years, and interest rate, and then displays the amortization schedule for the loan.
#### 0525 (Demonstrate cancellation errors) 
Write a program that compares the results of the summation of the series:  
 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/n  
 computing both from left to right and from right to left with n = 50000.
#### 0526 (Sum a series) 
Write a program to sum the following series:  
1/3 + 3/5 + 5/7 + 7/9 + 9/11 + 11/13 + ... + 95/97 + 97/99
#### 0527 5.27 (Compute pi)
You can approximate by using the following series:
pi = 4(1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 - 1/11 + ... + (-1)<sup>(i+1)</sup> / (2i - 1)  
Write a program that displays the $pi$ value for i = 10000, 20000, ..., and 100000.
#### 0528 (Compute e) 
You can approximate e by using the following series:
e = 1 + 1/1! + 1/2! + 1/3! + 1/4! + ... + 1/i!  
Write a program that displays the e value for i = 10000, 20000, ..., and 100000.
#### 0532 (Financial application: compound value) 
Suppose you save $100 each month into a savings account with the annual interest rate 5%. So, the monthly interest rate is 0.05/12 = 0.00417.  
After the first month, the value in the account becomes  
100 * (1 + 0.00417) = 100.417  
After the second month, the value in the account becomes  
(100 + 100.417) * (1 + 0.00417) = 201.252  
After the third month, the value in the account becomes  
(100 + 201.252) * (1 + 0.00417) = 302.507  
and so on.  
Write a program that prompts the user to enter an amount (e.g., 100), the annual
interest rate (e.g., 5), and the number of months (e.g., 6), and displays the amount
in the savings account after the given month.
#### 0542 (Monte Carlo simulation) 
A square is divided into four smaller regions. If you throw a dart into the square one million times, what is the probability for
the dart to fall into an odd-numbered region? Write a program to simulate the
process and display the result.
#### 0546 (Statistics: compute mean and standard deviation) 
In business applications, you are often asked to compute the mean and standard deviation of data. The mean is
simply the average of the numbers. The standard deviation is a statistic that tells
you how tightly all the various data are clustered around the mean in a set of data.  
Write a program that prompts the user to enter ten numbers, and displays the mean and standard deviations
of these numbers
