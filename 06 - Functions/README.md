# 06 - Functions
#### 0601 (Math: pentagonal numbers) 
A pentagonal number is defined as n(3n - 1)/2 for n = 1, 2, .... 
The first few numbers are 1, 5, 12, 22, ....   
Write a function with the following header that returns a pentagonal number:  
def getPentagonalNumber(n):  
Write a test program that uses this function to display the first 100 pentagonal
numbers with 10 numbers on each line.
#### 0602 (Sum the digits in an integer) 
Write a function that computes the sum of the digits in an integer.   
For example, sumDigits(234) returns 9 (2 + 3 + 4).  
Write a test program that prompts the user to enter an integer and displays the sum of all its digits.
#### 0603 (Palindrome integer) 
Write the functions with the following headers:  
def reverse(number):  
Return true if number is a palindrome  
def isPalindrome(number):  
A number is a palindrome if its reversal is the same as itself.   
Write a test program that prompts the user to enter an integer and reports whether the integer is a palindrome.
#### 0604 (Display an integer reversed) 
Write the following function to display an integer in reverse order:
def reverse(number):
For example, reverse(3456) displays 6543.  
Write a test program that prompts the user to enter an integer and displays its reversal.
#### 0605 (Sort three numbers) 
Write the following function to display three numbers in increasing order:
def displaySortedNumbers(num1, num2, num3):  
Write a test program that prompts the user to enter three numbers and invokes the
function to display them in increasing order.
#### 0608 Conversions between Celsius and Fahrenheit) 
Write a module that contains the following two functions:  

def celsiusToFahrenheit(celsius):  
Converts from Celsius to Fahrenheit  

def fahrenheitToCelsius(fahrenheit):  
Converts from Fahrenheit to Celsius  

The formulas for the conversion are:  
celsius = (5 / 9) * (fahrenheit â€“ 32)  
fahrenheit = (9 / 5) * celsius + 32  
Write a test program that invokes these functions to display tables.
#### 0609 (Conversions between feet and meters) 
Write a module that contains the following two functions:

def footToMeter(foot):  
Converts from feet to meters

def meterToFoot(meter):  
Converts from meters to feet

The formulas for the conversion are:  
foot = meter / 0.305  
meter = 0.305 * foot  
Write a test program that invokes these functions to display tables.

#### 0610 (Use the isPrime Function) 
Listing 6.7, PrimeNumberFunction.py, provides the isPrime(number) function for testing whether a number is prime. Use this
function to find the number of prime numbers less than 10,000.

#### 0613 (Sum series) 
Write a function to compute the following series:  
m(i) = 1/2 + 2/3 + ... + i/(i + 1)  
Write a test program that displays a table.

#### 0614 (Estimate pi) 
Pi can be computed using the following series:  
pi = 4(1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + 1/9 - 1/11 + ... + (-1)<sup>(i+1)</sup> / (2i - 1)  
Write a function that returns m(i) for a given i and write a test program that displays a table.

#### 0624 (Palindromic prime) 
A palindromic prime is a prime number that is also palindromic.  
For example, 131 is a prime and also a palindromic prime, as are 313 and
757. Write a program that displays the first 100 palindromic prime numbers. Display
10 numbers per line and align the numbers properly, as follows:  
2 3 5 7 11 101 131 151 181 191  
313 353 373 383 727 757 787 797 919 929
